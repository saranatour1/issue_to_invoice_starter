# Issue → Invoice

Issue → Invoice is a web app that connects issue intake → estimates → time tracking → invoicing.

## Public page

- `/` — Product overview and sign-in entry point.

## App pages (require sign-in; not intended for indexing)

- `/_authenticated/...` — Dashboard (issues, time tracking, invoices).

## Core concepts (agent-friendly summary)

- Projects: group work by client/team.
- Issues: track requests and tasks; can include sub-issues.
- Favorites: star issues for quick access.
- Links: model dependencies (`blocked by`) and loose relationships (`related`).
